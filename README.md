## `ssh-http-agent`

An HTTP Agent for tunneling through SSH

### Install

```
npm install --save ssh-http-agent
```

### Features

* Simple
* Single ssh client can make multiple requests

### Usage

Simple tunnel via `1.2.3.4`:

```js
const sshAgent = require("ssh-http-agent");
const http = require("http");

http.get(
  {
    agent: sshAgent.http({
      host: "1.2.3.4",
      port: 22,
      username: "root",
      password: "supersecret"
    }),
    host: "echo.jpillora.com",
    path: "/foo/bar"
  },
  res => {
    console.log(res.headers);
  }
);
```

Nested tunnels:

```js
const sshAgent = require("ssh-http-agent");
const http = require("http");

http.get(
  {
    agent: sshAgent.http([
      {
        host: "first.hop.com",
        username: "root",
        password: "supersecret"
      },
      {
        host: "second.hop.com",
        username: "root",
        password: "supersecret"
      }
    ]),
    host: "third.hop.com",
    path: "/foo/bar"
  },
  res => {
    console.log(res.headers);
  }
);
```

With `request`:

```js
const sshAgent = require("ssh-http-agent");
const request = require("request");

request.get(
  "http://echo.jpillora.com/foo/bar",
  {
    agent: sshAgent.http({
      host: "1.2.3.4",
      username: "root",
      password: "supersecret"
    })
  },
  (err, res, body) => {
    console.log(err || body);
  }
);
```

### API

Create an agent with:

* `sshAgent(httpAgent, sshConfig, debug)`
* `sshAgent.http(sshConfig, debug)`
* `sshAgent.https(sshConfig, debug)`

Where:

* `httpAgent` is an instance of [`http.Agent`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent) or [`https.Agent`](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_class_https_agent)
* `sshConfig` is one or many `ssh2` client configuration objects(https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2#client-methods)
* `debug` is a `boolean` which enabled debug printing

### Notes

* Requires Node 8+
